# Skarabee PHP API class

This Skarabee PHP API class connects with the [Skarabee SOAP API](http://www.skarabee.be), called Weblink.

## Work in progress

All functions in this class works,
but the following two functions are untested:
- [ ] Skarabee::addContactMessage
- [ ] Skarabee::pingBack

## Documentation

The class is well documented inline. If you use a decent IDE you'll see that each method is documented with PHPDoc.
